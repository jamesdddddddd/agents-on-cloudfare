#these are all the prompts used when trying out cloudfare ai workers for the first time 

i like the content moderation idea, i want to show if a sentence is positive negative or what feelings it might be conveying. so this can be used for security purposes

used AI prompts to help me decide the right model to use, although this eventually didnt work so I had to find it myself


how can i take user input through a text box on the site, since currently the only way to input something is by editing the url


but when i enter text i get the error "cant connect to worker"
